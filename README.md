jQuery Playground
=============

Some of my hacks/tweaks to jquery/jquery ui once i get more....

jQuery UI sortable (ui/jquery.ui.sortable.js based on jQuery UI 1.9.0m8)
-------
The jQuery ui sortable in this repo has been patched so support multiple elements as it's currentItem.
This means that mutiple sort is possible.

jQuery UI selectable click (ui/jquery.ui.selectable_click)
-------
This is a very simple selectable plugin based on the click event.
